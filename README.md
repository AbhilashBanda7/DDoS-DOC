# DDoS-DOC
# ABSTRACT
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks represent one of the most serious threats to 
network security, leading to significant losses in cybersecurity. This project focuses on 
developing both an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and an Intrusion Prevention System 
(IPS). The detection system leverages machine learning techniques and spectral analysis to 
identify abnormal activities within the network. Meanwhile, the prevention system employs 
statistical methods, including Quartile and Z-score distributions, along with Partial Differential 
Equations (PDEs), to detect variations in network traffic. These tools facilitate the generation 
of early warning and emergency alerts, allowing for timely intervention before an attack 
escalates. The proposed system offers a comprehensive approach to DDoS defense, combining 
data-driven learning with mathematical modeling, resulting in improved accuracy and 
responsiveness in threat detection and prevention.
